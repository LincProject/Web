<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>We are a group of Computer Science students at the University of Lincoln. We're currently researching and developing an application that enables users to create, edit and collaborate Mind-Maps online.</p>

<p>The main aim of the project is to develop a working artefact online, but should also be compatible on mobile devices.
We have chosen to develop the application using technologies such as: HTML5, CSS, jQuery and PHP. One of the main reasons behind choosing such platform(s) and languages is the scope and compatibly these have. By choosing to build and host online, it increases the number of platforms that can access the application. </p>  

<h1>How it works</h1>
<b>Over view</b>
<p>
MultiMind works by allowing the users to create Mind-Maps (like they would normally) online using a clean, interactive interface. This provides the user to be able to create and access their Mind-Map anywhere.</p>

<b>Sharing</b><br />
<p>Typically Mind-Maps are done by one person, a technique used to just simply and easily scribble ideas that you may have. However, at MultiMind we appreciate that sometimes Mind-Maps are done in groups, and, sometimes arranging to meet with that group on a particular day can be awkward and frustrating. <br /><br />

MultiMind has developed a system that allows multiple users to be able to view and edit the Mind-Maps at any one time <i>cool eh? ;).</i> This is done easily and interactively so is a lot more user friendly and is a lot more <b>accessible</b> than building on one mobile application <br />(<i>Be honest, does everyone have the same phone?</i>)</p>

<b>Signing up and costing</b>
<p>We have made signing up easy, and, it only takes around 2 seconds of your time. There is not a massive form that you have to complete and enter all your personal information (<i>Who wants that?!?1</i>). You can sign up <a href="users/signup">here</a>!</p>

<p>As MultiMind is a research project, it is completely free to sign up and use (<i>Restrictions may apply)</i> however this may not always be the case, and, therefore, it is always a good idea to check. - <b>Free stuff. With no Advertisements!</b></p>
