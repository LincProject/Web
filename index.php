<h2 class="why">What?</h2>
<p>We're developing an online Mind-Map collaboration tool that lets users instantly develop Mind-Maps online for free which can be then shared with their friends and colleagues. Multi-Mind is a free, open-source tool. </p>

<h2 class="why">Why?</h2>
<p>We're a group of students from the Lincoln School of Computer Science and as part of our group work, we need to produce an artefact on online collaborating Mind-Maps.</p>
